title:  JuliaGraphs&#58; Graph packages for the Julia language
---

# What is Julia?
[Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing"](http://julialang.org).
It is free (open source) and supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. It has a familiar
syntax, works well with external libraries, is fast, and has advanced language
features like metaprogramming that enable interesting possibilities for
Graphsimization software.


# What is JuliaGraphs?
JuliaGraphs is an organization that brings together packages written in Julia
for using and studying graphs.

# Overview of Packages

JuliaGraphs's packages can be loosely grouped into two sets. The first set are standalone Julia packages:

- **LightGraphs.jl**: An optimized lightweight graphs package for Julia. 
Implementations in Julia of standard Graphs algorithms and analytics.
[code](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl)
[docs](https://juliagraphs.github.io/LightGraphs.jl/latest/)

- **NetworkLayout.jl**: Layout algorithms for graphs and trees in pure Julia.
[code](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/NetworkLayout.jl)

- **LightGraphsExtras.jl**: Additional functionality for LightGraphs.jl.
[code](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphsExtras.jl)

- **GraphPlot.jl**: Graph visualization for Julia.
[code](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphPlot.jl)

- **Networks.jl**: Additional graph flexibility for LightGraphs.
[code](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Networks.jl)

- **JuliaGraphs-meta**: Forum for JuliaGraphs discussion - issues only.

- **GraphVisualize.jl**: An alternative implementation of graph visualization.
